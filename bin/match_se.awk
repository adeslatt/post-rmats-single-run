# Read file B, each of the new sorted arrays and store the matching columns in an associative array
# an associative array is a key-value pair
# where the key is the unique identifier that yields the value
# in our case the values are the IJC and SJC which are unique to this
# sample
#
# Each individual sorted array is as follows:
#
#          col 1 - GeneID
#          col 2 - geneSymbol
#          col 3 - chr
#          col 4 - strand
#          col 5 - exonStart_0base
#          col 6 - exonEnd
#          col 7 - upstreamES
#          col 8 - upstreamEE
#          col 9 - downstreamES
#          col 10 - downstreamEE
#          col 11 - IJC_SAMPLE_1
#          col 12 - SJC_SAMPLE_1
#

# A is the union file and is as follows
#
#          col 1 - ID
#          col 2 - GeneID
#          col 3 - geneSymbol
#          col 4 - chr
#          col 5 - strand
#          col 6 - exonStart_0base

#          col 8 - upstreamES
#          col 9 - upstreamEE
#          col 10 - downstreamES
#          col 11 - downstreamEE
#
#
# The match will print out the content of A, the union file, and the Counts from sample B, the individual file of IJC and SJC
#
# this ensures all the individual samples files have the same structure and IDs for making a single matrix
#
